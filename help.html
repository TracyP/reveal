  <h1>How to Play Reveal</h1>
  <p>Each day, everyone gets the same hidden word. Your goal is to guess all its letters.</p>

  <h2>Rules</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Start with a blank word — no hints.</li>
    <li>Tap letters to guess them.</li>
    <li>If correct, all positions of that letter are revealed in <strong>green</strong>.</li>
    <li>If incorrect, the letter turns <strong>red</strong> on the keyboard, and the game reveals a new letter (in grey) as a hint.</li>
    <li>All instances of any revealed letter (guessed or hinted) are shown at once.</li>
    <li>The game ends when all letters have been revealed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Scoring</h2>
  <p>You’ll see:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Correct Letters</strong>: how many letters you revealed by guessing.</li>
    <li><strong>Hints</strong>: how many letters were revealed automatically after wrong guesses.</li>
    <li><strong>Time</strong>: how long you took to complete the puzzle.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Strategy Tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Start with common letters like E, A, R, T, S.</li>
    <li>Guess cautiously — wrong guesses lead to hints, which lower your score.</li>
    <li>Watch out for repeated letters — they all appear at once!</li>
  </ul>
