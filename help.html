  <h1>How to Play</h1>
  <p><strong>Reveal</strong> is a daily word puzzle. Each day, all players around the world are given the same mystery word to uncover, one letter at a time.</p>

  <h2>Rules</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The word is between 6–9 letters long. Its length is shown to you from the start.</li>
    <li>Click letters to guess if they’re in the word.</li>
    <li>If you guess correctly, that letter is revealed everywhere it appears.</li>
    <li>If the letter is not in the word, it’s marked in red on the keyboard.</li>
    <li><strong>Hints start after three guesses.</strong> From your 4th guess onward, a new letter will be revealed as a grey hint each time you’re wrong.</li>
    <li>Each letter is only hinted once. If a hint reveals a letter that appears multiple times, all its positions will show.</li>
    <li>The game ends once all letters of the word are revealed, whether by guessing or hints.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Scoring</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Correct Letters:</strong> How many letters you revealed by guessing correctly.</li>
    <li><strong>Hints:</strong> How many letters were revealed to you as hints.</li>
    <li><strong>Time Taken:</strong> How long you took to complete the puzzle.</li>
    <li>Streaks are tracked locally — play daily to keep your streak going!</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Sharing</h2>
  <p>Once you finish, click <em>Copy</em> to share your stats with friends — the word is never revealed in the summary!</p>
